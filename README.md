# Express.js Route Handler Error Handling Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers:  missing error handling for invalid input. The `bug.js` file contains code that attempts to access a user by ID but lacks proper error handling if the ID is not a number. This can lead to unexpected application crashes or errors.

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version of the code that includes comprehensive error handling, preventing crashes and providing informative error responses to the client.
